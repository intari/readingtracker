{"name":"Reading Tracker","tagline":"Now you are in control of what you read","body":"# What's this?\r\nApplication to collect data on your reading habits. Which books you read. When you read. How much you read.\r\nSo you could analyze this data for yourself.\r\n\r\n# Current build status:\r\n* According to my Jenkinks instance:master branch: [![Build Status](http://jessica3.viorsan.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=ReadingTracker - master)](http://jessica3.viorsan.com:8080/job/ReadingTracker%20-%20master/)\r\n* According to my Jenkinks instance: develop branch: [![Build Status](http://jessica3.viorsan.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=ReadingTracker - develop)](http://jessica3.viorsan.com:8080/job/ReadingTracker%20-%20develop/)\r\n\r\n# How it works? (Non-technical)\r\nIn the beginning there was a phrase \"The Amazon Kindle reports which pages of which books the user looks at, and when\"...but I wanted this information too, for e-books I read using e-book readers I read.\r\n\r\n# How it works? (Technical)\r\nAndroid Accessibility APIs are used to 'read' parts of supported e-book reader's views.\r\nData are to [Parse](parse.com) cloud service for later processing and analysis.\r\nAfter that e-mails are send to me using [Mandrill](mandrillapp.com) and record is added to my [Evernote](evernote.com) notebook using [Zapier](zapier.com).\r\nIn future various interesting graphs could be made once I collect enough statistics\r\n\r\n# Application requirements\r\n* Android 4.3+ (last version of code with support for 4.2 is at https://github.com/intari/readingtracker/tree/Last_API_17_Android_4_2 , it's much easier to work at API Level 18)\r\n* Suppported e-book reader\r\n* Android tablet or phone\r\n\r\n# Android 5.0.1 Lollipop support\r\n* As of version 1.6.8 application should work correctly with Lollipop\r\n\r\n# Which e-book readers are supported?\r\nCurrently all editions of Mantano Reader are supported (it's great. Please buy it. If you want to used it on multiple devices you should buy their cloud subscription too).\r\nOthers are not supported yet.\r\n\r\nPlease note authors of ebook readers don't endorse this app.\r\n\r\n# YotaPhone2 support\r\n* Currently YotapPhone2 supported as regular device (no support for Mantano's ability to use e-ink screen). This will be fixed if/when I get access to YotaPhone2\r\n\r\n# How to use application (assuming you use Google Play version):\r\n* Install one of supported ebook readers\r\n* Install this app\r\n* enable access to accessibility services for app\r\n* open & read books from reader's Library view\r\n* you could confirm everything was detecred correctly by opening app again and checking it saw details\r\n* when you close book you will get e-mail from my bot intari@viorsan.com.\r\nBot's message will be in Russian if bot thinks you are speak Russian or in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What about analytics, Evernote integration?\r\nAnalytics will be possible in future versions.\r\nAbility to setup integration with [Zapier](zapier.com) web-hooks (support for [Evernote](evernote.com) was done this way) is not yet available in application's interface\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Which Android Permissions are used and why\r\n  Permissions\r\n  * RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED  - to be able to catch moments when you start read\r\n  * INTERNET - communication with our server\r\n  * ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - usage analytics and error reporting.\r\n  * READ_PHONE_STATE - statistics\r\n  * GET_TASKS - to knew when you switch from supported reading app to something other\r\n  * WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - automatic updates of non-PlayStore versions using HockeyApp\r\n  * BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE - main app functionality. you will be asked to provide access to 'Accessibility Services' on startup. You could refuse but you will not be able to get your statistics from this device\r\n  * WAKE_LOCK / VIBRATE / GET_ACCOUNTS - Parse-based push notifications\r\n\r\n# Licenses\r\nMy own code is licensed under GPLv3, exception is given to link all libraries I link to (Parse,etc).
