How much you read.\r\nSo you could analyze this data for yourself.\r\n\r\n# How it works? (Non-technical)\r\nIn the begging there was a phrase \"The Amazon Kindle reports which pages of which books the user looks at, and when\"...but I wanted this information too, for e-books I read using e-book readers I read.\r\n\r\n# How it works? (Technical)\r\nAndroid Accessibility APIs are used to 'read' parts of supported e-book reader's views.\r\nData are to [Parse](parse.com) cloud service for later processing and analysis.\r\nAfter that e-mails are send to me using [Mandrill](mandrillapp.com) and record is added to my [Evernote](evernote.com) notebook using [Zapier](zapier.com).\r\nIn future various interesting graphs could be made once I collect enough statistics\r\n\r\n# Requirements for using\r\n* Android 4.3+ (last version of code with support for 4.2 is at https://github.com/intari/readingtracker/tree/Last_API_17_Android_4_2 , it's much easier to work at API Level 18)\r\n\r\n# Requirements for building\r\n* Android SDK 21\r\n* Configure correct API Keys, if don't do this, your build WILL fail\r\n* cd $HOME\r\n* mkdir .androidSigning/\r\n* touch booktrackerAPIKeys\r\n* edit booktrackerAPIKeys to add:\r\n  * PARSE_APP_ID=your_parse_app_id (https://parse.com/ , Application used Parse as network backend\r\n  * PARSE_CLIENT_KEY=your_parse_client_key\r\n  * PARSE_MASTER_KEY=master_key_for your_parse_application (used for crash reporting)\r\n  * HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID=your_HockeApp_app_id (used to check for updates if they are distributed via HockeyApp)\r\n  * HOCKEYAPP_TOKEN=your_HockeyApp_token (for this app, used to automatically upload updated version here)\r\n  * PARSE_APP_ID_FOR_TEST_HARNESS=not currently used but something must be put here\r\n  * PARSE_CLIENT_KEY_FOR_TEST_HARNESS=not currently used but something must be put here\r\n  * PARSE_USERNAME_FOR_TEST_HARNESS=not currently used but something must be put here\r\n  * PARSE_PASSWORD_FOR_TEST_HARNESS=not currently used but something must be put here\r\n  * COUNTLY_SERVER = count.ly analytics server URL\r\n  * COUNTLY_APPKEY = count.ly analytics App Key\r\n  * FLURRY_APIKEY = Flurry's API Key (currently disabled but something must be here)\r\n  * VERSION_CODE_AUTH/VERSION_CODE_URL - see build.gradle, those are used to get monotonically increasing build numbers. It's likely you will want change those parts of build.gradle\r\n    you can change paths in gradle.properties\r\n\r\n* or look at build.gradle to determine how to use env vars\r\n\r\n# Which e-book readers are supported for integration\r\nCurrently Mantano Reader Premium is supported (it's great. Please buy it. If you want to used it on multiple devices you should buy their cloud subscription too).\r\nMantano Essentials and Mantano Lite should also work.\r\nOthers are not supported yet.\r\n\r\nPlease note authors of ebook readers don't endorse this app.\r\n\r\n# Where are sources for CloudCode part?\r\nNot in this repository yet\r\n\r\n# Which Android Permissions are used and why\r\n  Permissions\r\n  * RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED  - to be able to catch moments when you start read\r\n  * INTERNET - communication with our server\r\n  * ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - usage analytics & error reporting.\r\n  * READ_PHONE_STATE - statistics\r\n  * GET_TASKS - to knew when you switch from supported reading app to something other\r\n  * WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - automatic updates of non-PlayStore versions using HockeyApp\r\n  * BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE - main app functionality. you will be asked to provide access to 'Accessibility Services' on startup. You could refuse but you will not be able to get your statistics from this device\r\n  * WAKE_LOCK / VIBRATE / GET_ACCOUNTS - Parse-based push notifications\r\n\r\n# Licenses\r\nMy own code is licensed under GPLv3, exception is given to link all libraries I link to (Parse,etc).
